## ‚ú® Why MoringaDesk?

### Problem
Learners repeatedly hit the same blockers during bootcamps and projects. Answers are scattered across Slack threads, mentor DMs, or forgotten Notion pages.

### Solution
MoringaDesk captures those questions and the best solutions in a single, API-first platform. Tagging, voting, and moderation ensure answers stay relevant and discoverable. Beyond Q&A, the platform surfaces FAQs, blog stories, and live service health to keep the community informed.

## üìö API & Integrations

- **REST reference:** `/api-docs` groups endpoints by domain with usage notes.
- **Status dashboard:** `/status` returns structured health checks suitable for uptime monitors.
- **Pagination:** Collection endpoints accept `page` & `per_page` parameters and respond with pagination metadata.
- **Blog API:** `/blog/posts` exposes public stories while authenticated admins can create, publish, and delete entries.

## ü§ù Contribution Flow

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/short-description`
2. Commit with clear, conventional messages.
3. Open a pull request describing the change and testing performed.
4. Ensure CI passes and request review from a maintainer.

We follow a lightweight Gitflow model and welcome issues/PRs that improve docs, tooling, or UX.
