              Why MoringaDesk exists
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              We set out to answer a simple question: how can learners retain the collective wisdom
              of every cohort and instructor? Traditional Q&A forums felt disconnected from the
              Moringa experience, while chat apps buried answers in endless threads. MoringaDesk
              combines the best of both worldsâ€”structured knowledge with the warmth of a peer
              community.
